# Groove is in the Heart

90s Aesthetic multiplatform project to explore the Compose animation project.
Android and Desktop for a start.

Form follows Fun~~ction~~

The title of this project reference is a dance hit from the 90s [Groove is in the Heart by Deee-lite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Is_in_the_Heart). Because of the 90s reference but also because there are a few heart paths in the samples. 

Listen to this playlist to get into the groove. This project has various sample screens that demonstrate the individual techniques used to emulate a 90s website. On the top bar you can navigate home from the examples, change the font and switch into the final version of the homes screen which incorporates all the examples.

For more info also see the slides and talk which was first presented at Android Makers x Droidcon 2023.
